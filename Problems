Description of used techonologies:
1) for synchroniztion I used semaphores, and their property that semop(....) operations are performed in an array order and atomically 


Problems:
1) Notify child that parent dead
	I used prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, ....) to solve this problem. It is important to check if parent died before prctl was used, I compare parent_pid which was gotten before calling fork() and getppid() result
