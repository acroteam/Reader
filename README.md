# Reader
This program read from file DB every time it is modified and copy that to OUT

# How to use
Use command "make two" or "make three" there is no differences in result, differences is in implementation. ./two use two processes and ./three - three :)

Before start you should create DB file. To stop programm send killing signal to the first process which was started by you.
